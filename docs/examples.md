## Tips for Customization

### Channel Naming
- Use emojis to make categories visually distinct
- Keep names descriptive but concise
- Use consistent naming patterns within categories

### Permission Design
- Start with restrictive permissions and open up as needed
- Use role hierarchy to your advantage
- Consider creating "Muted" roles for temporary restrictions

### Voice Channel Strategy
- Create multiple voice channels for different purposes
- Use descriptive names that indicate the channel's purpose
- Consider creating "AFK" and "Music Bot" channels

### Category Organization
- Group related channels together
- Use clear, descriptive category names
- Consider the user experience when organizing channels

These examples should give you a solid foundation for creating your own Manto configurations. Remember to adapt them to your specific needs and community requirements.
