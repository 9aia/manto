# Examples

This section provides real-world examples of Manto configurations for different types of Discord servers. Use these as inspiration and starting points for your own configurations.

There are 3 examples available as a complete folder in the `examples/` directory:

- [`examples/study-group/`](../examples/study-group/) - Study-focused server for students
