# Manto Documentation

Welcome to Manto, an innovative approach to Discord server configuration that brings the power of file systems, allowing version control and transparent collaboration to your Discord server management.

## What is Manto?

Manto is a toolchain that transforms Discord server configuration from a complex, manual process into a structured, file-based system. Instead of clicking through Discord's interface to configure channels, roles, and permissions, you define everything using YAML files in a familiar directory structure.

## Key Benefits

- **Version Control**: Track changes to your server configuration using Git
- **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on server configuration simultaneously on GitHub
- **Automation**: Deploy configuration changes automatically through bots and CI/CD
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent server setups across different environments
- **Backup & Recovery**: Easy backup and restoration of server configurations
